Performance Comparison - 30째 Steering Limit
---------------------------------------------

RMS CTE (30째 optimized path): 1.3697 m
Path Length (30째 optimized): 593.72 m
Total Simulation Time: 1000.00 s

Observations on 30째 Steering Limit Effects:
- More gradual turns requiring larger turning radius
- Different optimal path sequence due to turning constraints
- More guided-point overrides needed during tight turns
